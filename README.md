# Vacancies-Spiders
This spider is written in python using the Scrapy framework. Iâ€™ve written this spiders in support of a research project in collecting Dutch health care vacancies . Please be aware that I'm not sure of the legality of this in a professional setting, so use it at your own risk. This code is run in Python 3.7.0 and Scrapy 1.5.1.
